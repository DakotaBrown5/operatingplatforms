1. Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room is the company behind the application we've built the framework for "Draw it or Lose It". They had previously developed an Android version of this game, but wanted to expand it to where it could be played on multiple different platforms in an attempt to increase their user base. They called on us to develop the framework of the game and to ensure that the game also has an option of being team-based.

2. What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I think I did most well in the Recommendations section at the bottom. It was fun looking at the needs of the client and then figuring out what the best way would be to make this application work well. I like the idea of saving resources for our customer by doing all of the rendering of images on the client side.

3. What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

It's nice to have a step by step framework of how to think about this problem and lead my thoughts and ideas from point A to point B. It helped a lot in organizing my thoughts rather than what the plan would look like without the framework included in the design document.

4. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would choose to revise the Evaluation section which shows the pros and cons of each operating system. There is such a large amount of information one would need to take in about each operating system, that becoming an expert on each one would take far longer than this single course. I'd like to study each one more in-depth so I could give an even more solid and thorough answer to The Gaming Room.

5. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I looked at what they needed done, then used my knowledge of what I've learned along with a bit of extra research to come up with the best solutions for them. It's obviously extremely important to consider the user's needs because if the user is satisfied, you can continue that developer-client relationship into the future. It also helps to build a reputation for doing great work to attract new customers if every customer you have, you listen to their requirements and you fulfill them exactly (or even better) than they asked for.

6. How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I designed it by closely inspecting what their needs are and then coming up with the solution that would make the most sense to them. As mentioned above, an example of this would be having the rendering done by the client which would save them a lot of resources and allow for an overall smoother gaming experience for their users. I plan to continue my study of computer science indefinitely into the future, so in the future I would apply all new techniques that I learned and continue designing better and better software applications.
